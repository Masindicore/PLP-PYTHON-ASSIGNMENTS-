Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib
Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The analysis is conducted on the classic Iris dataset, which contains measurements of various iris flower species.

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers, with the following features:

sepal length (cm)

sepal width (cm)

petal length (cm)

petal width (cm)

species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Project Structure
The project includes the following components:

Data Loading and Exploration

Loading the dataset from scikit-learn

Displaying the first few rows

Checking data types and missing values

Basic Data Analysis

Generating descriptive statistics

Calculating mean values grouped by species

Identifying patterns in the data

Data Visualization

Line chart showing trends of sepal and petal lengths

Bar chart comparing average sepal width by species

Histogram displaying distribution of petal lengths

Scatter plot showing relationship between sepal and petal lengths

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

seaborn (for plot styling)

Install the requirements using:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
How to Run
Execute the Python script in any environment that supports Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. The code will:

Load and explore the dataset

Perform basic statistical analysis

Generate four different visualizations

Key Findings
Setosa species have significantly smaller petal measurements compared to other species

Virginica species have the largest sepals on average

Strong positive correlation exists between sepal length and petal length

Petal length measurements show a bimodal distribution

Visualizations
The script generates the following plots:

Line chart comparing sepal and petal length trends

Bar chart showing average sepal width by species

Histogram of petal length distribution

Scatter plot of sepal length vs petal length (colored by species)

Each visualization includes appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends for clear interpretation.
